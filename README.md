# UFOs - The Thruth Is Out There

### **Purpose**
After gathering the initial sightings data and setting up *Dana's dynamic webpage*, some additional work was needed to allow users to take advantage of the many other filters the database has to offer.<br>

This is why we **added 4 extra filters** to further analyze the sightings information. 
Please read the following instructions:

#

## **UFO - filtering process**
As initially developed, the header remained without any changes and basically shows a brief article about UFO sightings as an introduction.

Also, the webpage still shows the **full sightings database** when no filter is applied to help with the initial exploration.

<br>
However, at the left side of the webpage, users will be able to find 5 input boxes to filter:

* Date 
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

<br>Using the sightings filters:</br>

_*NOTE: The Database will now be updated automatically as each filter is updated._

## **Future Recommendations**
Even if the webpage is now able to provide a more dynamic view of the sightings data, the work is still far from flawless. 

Some minor drawbacks may include the impossibility to gather more than one day of information at a time or perhaps, there's the issue that users will still need to scroll down on the entire database to find the diferent information they can filter.

So as part of the UFO's webpage next steps:
* Additional time-filtering tools will be added to select entire periods to filter.
* Also, a drop down list option will be tested so that users may quickly filter any information they need without scrolling down the webpage.
